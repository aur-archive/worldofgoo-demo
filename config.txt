  <!-- This controls the audio driver used by the game. 
       If set to "auto" (default) a suitable driver is determined automatically
       at runtime. You can override the selected driver by setting this variable
       to one of the following values:
           "pulse"  for PulseAudio
           "alsa"   for ALSA 0.9 PCM audio
           "dsp"    for OSS /dev/dsp standard audio
           "dma"    for OSS /dev/dsp DMA audio
           "arts"   for Analog Realtime Synthesizer (aRts)
           "esd"    for Enlightened Sound Daemon (EsounD, ESD) -->
  <env name="SDL_AUDIODRIVER" value="alsa" overwrite="true" />

  <!-- This forces the NVIDIA driver to sync on vertical blanking.
       Turn this off if you experience performance problems. -->
  <env name="__GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK" value="1" overwrite="true" />

  <!-- This determines whether DGA is used (when available) for mouse movement.
       In theory this would be more precise, but this does not scale well to
       different resolutions. -->
  <env name="SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE" value="0" overwrite="true" />

  <!-- This changes the mouse acceleration in the game.
       Value is of the form "x/y/z" (x, y and z being integers) where x/y is a
       fraction specifying the acceleration factor, and z is the movement speed
       threshold above which acceleration applies. -->
  <!-- <env name="SDL_VIDEO_X11_MOUSEACCEL" value="2/1/0" overwite="true" /> -->

  <!-- Set this to 1 to use the XRandR extension for mode switching; may fix 
       mode selection problems in multiple-monitor configurations. -->
